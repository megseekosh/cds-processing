code to replicate results in "Acoustic-lexical characteristics of child-directed speech between 7 and 24 months and their impact on toddlers' phonological processing"

## Datasets and dictionaries

`7658LT7mosChild_5_minscoartic.csv` - used to run `1_acoustic_results.Rmd`; dataframe containing the acoustic measures of coarticulation for all word tokens in each caregiver-child interaction at 7, 10, 18 (where applicable), and 24 months

`IPhOD2_Words.csv` - the Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary, Version 2.0 (Vaden et al., 2009)

`acoustic_measures.csv` - dataframe generated from `1_acoustic_results.Rmd`; contains formant measurements, coarticulation measures, vowel space measurements, phone duration, and word duration from all word tokens in each caregiver-child interaction at 7, 10, 18 (where applicable), and 24 months 

`child_birthdates_84_public.csv` - used to run `2_lexical_results.Rmd`; contains children's ages at task completion; public dataframe omits children's birthdates 

`descrip_vowels.csv.zip` - used to run `1_acoustic_results.Rmd`; generated by [triple formant tracker](https://github.com/megseekosh/vocal_tract_vowel); contains descriptive information about vowel measurements (vowel identity, surrounding context, time, speaker)

`ethnicity_data.csv` - used to run `2_lexical_results.Rmd`; contains demographic information for children 

`med_formants.csv` - used to run `1_acoustic_results.Rmd`; contains formant measurements generated by triple formant tracker [triple formant tracker](https://github.com/megseekosh/vocal_tract_vowel) for all peripheral vowels in all word tokens in each caregiver-child interaction at 7, 10, 18 (where applicable), and 24 months

`stat.frq.csv` - used to run `2_lexical_results.Rmd`; dataframe generated from Newman-Ratner corpus via CLAN; contains counts for all word tokens in each caregiver-child interaction at 7, 10, 18 (where applicable), and 24 months

## Analysis

`1_acoustic_results.Rmd` - process formant measurements and coarticulatory data; compute vowel space area and degree of coarticulation for each caregiver at each time point; required to generate `acoustic_measures.csv` and run `2_lexical_results.Rmd`

`2_lexical_results.Rmd` - contains code and prose to replicate results section of manuscript, including all tables, figures, and modeling

`2_lexical_results.pdf` - pdf of results section of manuscript

## Manuscripts and figures

`2_lexical_results_files/figure-latex` - directory containing figures generated from `2_lexical_results.pdf`

`CDS_nonword_public.pdf` - complete, compiled manuscript

`CDS_nonword_public_supp.pdf` - file containing supplementary figures and model summaries

`cds_nonword_acoustics.jpg` - mediation plot of acoustic predictors (at 10mos) on phonological processing and vocabulary size (at 24mos)

`cds_nonword_mediation_10mos.jpg` - mediation plot of lexical predictors (at 10mos) on phonological processing and vocabulary size (at 24mos); included in supplementary materials

`cds_nonword_mediation_18mos.jpg` - mediation plot of lexical predictors (at 18mos) on phonological processing and vocabulary size (at 24mos)

`cds_nonword_mediation_7mos.jpg` - mediation plot of lexical predictors (at 7mos) on phonological processing and vocabulary size (at 24mos)
